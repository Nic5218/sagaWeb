    <h2>About Our Research</h2>
    <p class="team_intro">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Icelandic Family Sagas are an intriguing window onto the social world of 10th and 11th century Iceland, seen
      through the authorial lens of late medieval writers. A striking characteristic of the sagas is the abundance of
      characters that interact in and across complex social networks as they first initiate and then try to resolve
      conflicts. Indeed, an enduring question in saga studies is how enmity arises between groups and how that enmity is
      eventually resolved. Since the main conflict resolution mechanism in early Icelandic society was the blood feud, the
      sagas can be quite violent at times. Yet nearly all sagas end with some form of a peaceful resolution and a return
      to social balance. Just as important as enmity is the concept of friendship. How is friendship perceived, how is
      friendship nurtured, and how is friendship violated in the saga? While the majority of saga scholarship has focused
      on a few main characters (the hero, the villain), or classes of characters (strong women), in developing analyses of
      these social conflicts, an approach that considers all of the characters in a saga (and possibly across multiple
      sagas), may help us develop a better understanding the dynamic complexity of these well-known works of late medieval
      fiction. In this project, we work on developing a comprehensive data set of character interaction networks for the
      Icelandic family sagas.</p>
